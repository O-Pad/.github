# OPAD - A Collaborative Text Editor
Distributed text editors are commonly used to support collaborative editing for software or document development. However, many existing solutions work with documents on the server; they do not support direct collaboration between two clients working with locally stored documents. 

**We propose a distributed text editor for real-time collaboration that stores the files locally.**
